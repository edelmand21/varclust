#' Variable Clustering with Multiple Latent Components Clustering algorithm
#'
#' Variable Clustering with Multiple Latent Components Clustering is based on k-means algorithm. 
#' In each step cluster centers are few PCA components, computed for variables in that cluster. 
#' Than distance is defined by R^2 (obtained by performing least-squares).
#'
#' The main function of package \pkg{VarClust} is
#' \code{\link{MPCV.BIC}} which allows you to cluster data 
#' with unknown number of clusters. Variable partition is computed
#' with k-means based algorithm. Number of clusters and their dimensions
#' are computed using BIC criterion.
#' If user knows the number of clusters one might use function \code{\link{MPCV.reps}},
#' which takes number of clusters as a parameter. For \code{\link{MPCV.reps}} one might 
#' specify as well some initial segmentation for k-means algorithm. This can be useful if
#' user has some apriori knowledge about clustering.
#' 
#' We also provide function \code{\link{missclassification}} that computes missclasification
#' rate between two partitions in which might have different labelings. This performance measure is 
#' extensively used in application to computer vision.
